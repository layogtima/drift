Issues:
Do not show submit if a url is already there (support query string)
• If liked or disliked; should show my liked/disliked for a site I’ve stumbled on
• If I click on my name, I can’t close the modal
• Tags should show all tags, I can select them and add more
• Ability to browse through one tag
• Website fonts sometimes override the driftbar
